## It's a New Year

Like many people, we have a new years resolution to deliver a weekly newsletter to our users. We think it's important that you are notified of the latest call for papers and exciting news we want to share!

### Amazing Support

We wanted to purchase more stickers for WordCamp US so we put together a GoFundMe campaign. The response we received was heart-warming. 

We raised enough money for stickers in a few short hours. We were able to take the additional funds and add them to your travel scholarship funds. 

We now have our first travel scholarship request and are working hard to raise $750 so we can cover her travel accommodations to speak at a conference. Help us find amazing company sponsors or just share the campaign with your network.
